What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was definitely an enjoyable assessment. I was very daunted by the
idea of working with pointers, but this assignment helped me understand
them much butter.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

I think, theoretically, it would not be possible to call assert to
verify whether the destination memory is large enough in the case of
Str_copy or Str_concat. While one would assume that it would be possible
to do so by simply asserting whether the length of the destination is
greater than or equal to the length of the source. However, the issue
that would arise is that the length is being checked for by looking for
a null terminating character. Since it is possible for the destination
array to contain null elements, it might be possible that there is
sufficient memory area for the destination even after the null
terminating character (as is the case for standard concat function calls
since the concat function begins adding the new string at the position
of the previous null pointer. Since it is difficult to then find the
length of the destination memory (since it can be sufficient but contain
null characters), I don't think it is possible to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough
for the Str_concat and Str_copy functions.
