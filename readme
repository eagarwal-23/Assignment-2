What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment. I was initially very daunted by
the concept of pointers, specifically, and was unsure about my ability
to be able to work with them. The recommended structure of this assign-
-ment, wherein we worked on two parallel implementations, was incredibly
helpful to me. As a result of being familiar with arrays, this parallel
structure enabled me to comprehend pointers and their operations through
that intermediate medium. I really enjoyed working with C, which I was
really afraid of working with at the beginning of the semester. Being
able to make that transition, thus, was incredibly exciting to me.
Overall, this assignment greatly facilitated my understanding of the
unique features of C, as well as was fun and makes me greatly look
forward to the rest of the course.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

I think, theoretically, it would not be possible to call assert to
verify whether the destination memory is large enough in the case of
Str_copy or Str_concat. While one would assume that it would be possible
to do so by simply asserting whether the length of the destination is
greater than or equal to the length of the source. However, the issue
that would arise is that the length is being checked for by looking for
a null terminating character. Since it is possible for the destination
array to contain null elements, it might be possible that there is
sufficient memory area for the destination even after the null
terminating character (as is the case for standard concat function calls
since the concat function begins adding the new string at the position
of the previous null pointer. Since it is difficult to then find the
length of the destination memory (since it can be sufficient but contain
null characters), I don't think it is possible to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough
for the Str_concat and Str_copy functions.
